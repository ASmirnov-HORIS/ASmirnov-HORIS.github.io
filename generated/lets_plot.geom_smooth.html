<dl class="field-list simple">
<dt class="field-odd">Parameters</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>mapping</strong> (<em>set of aesthetic mappings created by aes() function.</em>) – Aesthetic mappings describe the way that variables in the data are
mapped to plot “aesthetics”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>data</strong> (<em>dictionary or pandas DataFrame, optional</em>) – The data to be displayed in this layer. If None, the default, the data
is inherited from the plot data as specified in the call to ggplot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stat</strong> (<em>string, optional</em>) – The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer, as a string. Supported transformations:
“identity” (leaves the data unchanged), “count” (counts number of points with same x-axis coordinate),
“bin” (counts number of points with x-axis coordinate in the same bin), “smooth” (performs smoothing -
linear default)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>position</strong> (<em>string, optional</em>) – Position adjustment, either as a string (“identity”, “stack”, “dodge”,…), or the result of a call to a
position adjustment function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>method</strong> (<em>smoothing method: lm (Linear Model) or loess (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing). Default - ‘lm’</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>n</strong> (<em>number of points to evaluate smoother at.</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>se</strong> (<em>boolean, to display confidence interval around smooth. Default - True</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>level</strong> (<em>level of confidence interval to use. Default - 0.95</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>span</strong> (<em>number, optional</em>) – Only for LOESS method. The fraction of source points closest to the current point
is taken into account for computing a least-squares regression. A sensible value is usually 0.25 to 0.5.
Default - 0.5</p></li>
<li><p><strong>deg</strong> (<em>degree of polynomial for linear regression model. Default - 1</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>seed</strong> (<em>random seed for LOESS sampling.</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>max_n</strong> (<em>maximum number of data-points for LOESS method. If this quantity exceeded random sampling</em>) – is applied to data. Default - 1000</p></li>
<li><p><strong>tooltips</strong> (<em>result of the call to the layer_tooltips() function.</em>) – Specifies appearance, style and content.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>other_args</strong> – Other arguments passed on to layer. These are often aesthetics settings, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed
value, like color = “red”, fill = “blue”, size = 3 or shape = 21. They may also be parameters to the
paired geom/stat.</p></li>

<p>geom_smooth aids the eye in seeing patterns in the presence of overplotting.
Computed variables:</p>

<li><p>y : predicted (smoothed) value</p></li>
<li><p>ymin : lower pointwise confidence interval around the mean</p></li>

<li><p>y : y-axis value</p></li>
<li><p>alpha : transparency level of a layer
Understands numbers between 0 and 1.</p></li>
<li><p>color (colour) : color of a geometry
Can be continuous or discrete. For continuous value this will be a color gradient between two colors.</p></li>
<li><p>linetype : type of the line of conditional mean line
Codes and names: 0 = “blank”, 1 = “solid”, 2 = “dashed”, 3 = “dotted”, 4 = “dotdash”,
5 = “longdash”, 6 = “twodash”</p></li>
